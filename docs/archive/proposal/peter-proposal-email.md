Subject: **Olympus Masonry Website - Project Proposal & Investment**

---

Hey Peter,

I hope you're doing well, and thank you for your patience as I've been putting together exactly what your masonry business needs.

You asked about building a website for Olympus Masonry, and I wanted to share a clear proposal that outlines what you'll receive and what the investment looks like. I believe in transparency, so I'll walk you through everything.

## **What You're Getting**

Great news—you've chosen **Sample #5 (Split Screen)** as your design direction! I'm excited to build this out for you. The bold, magazine-style 50/50 vertical split layout with the gold dividing line will give Olympus Masonry a distinctive, modern presence that stands out from typical contractor websites.

Here's what the full project includes:

**Your Professional Masonry Website:**
- Complete website built from the Split Screen design
- 5-7 core pages (Home, Services, Portfolio/Gallery, About, Contact)
- Mobile-responsive design (works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers)
- Contact form for quote requests
- Professional portfolio gallery to showcase your masonry work
- Fast loading speed and modern design
- All content integrated (your business info, services, photos, testimonials)

**Why this matters for your business:**
This isn't just about having a website—it's about giving Olympus Masonry a professional digital presence that builds credibility with high-end clients, showcases your craftsmanship, and makes it easy for potential customers to contact you for quotes. The Split Screen design is particularly effective for balancing visual impact with clear messaging.

## **Investment Breakdown**

I structure my services in two parts to give you flexibility:

### **Part 1: Initial Website Build**
**One-Time Investment: $5,500 CAD**

This covers the complete design and development of your website from start to finish. You'll receive:
- Full website build based on the Split Screen design
- All pages designed and developed
- Content integration
- Initial setup and launch
- Training on how to access and understand your site

*Typical timeline: 4-6 weeks from final design approval to launch*

### **Part 2: Monthly Care Package**
**Ongoing: $350 CAD/month** *(Month-to-month, no long-term commitment required)*

Here's what many business owners don't realize: websites require ongoing care to stay secure, fast, and functional. Think of it like a vehicle—you don't just buy it and never change the oil.

**Your Monthly Care Package includes:**

✅ **Security & Protection**
- Regular security updates and patches to keep your site safe from threats
- Automated backups (so we can restore if anything ever goes wrong)
- Uptime monitoring to ensure your site is always accessible to customers

✅ **Performance & Maintenance**
- Performance optimization to keep your site loading quickly
- Bug fixes and troubleshooting if any issues arise
- Software and plugin updates

✅ **Content Support**
- 2 hours per month of content updates (new photos, text changes, service updates)
- Perfect for adding new project photos or updating seasonal information

✅ **Support & Management**
- Email support with 48-hour response time
- Hosting management (where your website lives on the internet)
- Domain management (your olympusconstruction.ca web address)
- SSL certificate management (the security "lock" icon in browsers)

**The flexibility:** This is month-to-month. If you ever feel you're not getting value, you can cancel with 30 days notice. No long-term contract required. My goal is to earn your business every month by keeping your site running smoothly and supporting your growth.

### **Infrastructure Costs (Included in Monthly Package)**

For transparency: every website requires certain recurring infrastructure costs that I manage on your behalf:
- **Domain registration:** $0.01 CAD/year (your olympusconstruction.ca web address - promotional pricing)
- **Professional hosting (Vercel Pro):** ~$28/month (secure, fast servers with enterprise CDN)
- **SSL certificate:** Included (security encryption for secure browsing)
- **Development & AI tools (Claude Max):** ~$294/month (for ongoing updates, optimization, and support)
- **Performance monitoring & optimization tools:** Included

These are industry-standard costs that every professional website requires. I bundle them into your monthly package so you have one simple payment and I handle all the technical management. The development tools allow me to efficiently maintain your site, implement updates quickly, and ensure optimal performance.

## **How This Approach Differs**

I want to be transparent about your options, because you could pursue other routes:

**Alternative Options Available:**
- **Freelancer platforms (Fiverr, Upwork):** Typically $300-$1,500 for basic website
- **DIY website builders (Wix, Squarespace):** $15-40/month, you build it yourself
- **College students/hobbyists:** Often $500-$2,000 for a website
- **Template-based solutions:** Quick and inexpensive

**Here's what makes my approach different:**

1. **Comprehensive Discovery & Strategy** - I researched your industry, analyzed 9 high-end masonry websites, documented your brand identity, and created 10 custom design options based on what actually converts leads in your industry. This isn't template work.

2. **Built for Your Business Goals** - Every design decision is made to attract high-end clients, showcase your craftsmanship, and make it easy for customers to contact you. Not just "a pretty website."

3. **Ongoing Partnership** - Most freelancers build and disappear. I'm available month-to-month to update content, fix issues, and keep your site performing optimally. Your business will evolve—your website should too.

4. **Quality & Reliability** - Professional-grade hosting, security, performance optimization, and support. No guessing if your site is down or hacked.

5. **Business Mindset** - I'm not just executing your requests—I'm thinking about what will help Olympus Masonry grow. That means asking the right questions, making strategic recommendations, and ensuring the final product works for your business.

**The choice is yours.** Budget options exist and might be the right fit depending on your goals and timeline. My approach is for business owners who see their website as an investment in growth, not just an expense to minimize.
