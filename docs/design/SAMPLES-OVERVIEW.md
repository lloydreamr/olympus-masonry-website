## What DIFFERS Between the 10 Samples

### Layout & Structure Only:
1. How sections are arranged
2. How much whitespace
3. Where images are placed
4. How carousels are used (or not)
5. Grid vs cards vs split-screen
6. Dark vs light backgrounds
7. How bold/minimal the design is

## For Peter to Evaluate

**When reviewing, Peter should consider:**

1. **Which layout shows off masonry work best?**
2. **Which feels most professional?**
3. **Which is easiest to navigate?**
4. **Which matches how he wants clients to see Olympus?**
5. **Light or dark backgrounds preference?**
6. **How much gold accent feels right?**
7. **Minimal or bold typography?**
8. **Simple or dynamic layouts?**

**The answer determines:** Which layout approach to build the full site with.

**What won't change:** The black, gold, white colors and clean fonts - that's locked in from the business card.

---

## Development Priority

**Focus on:**
- Layout variety ✅
- Visual distinction between samples ✅
- Professional execution ✅
- Mobile responsiveness ✅

**Don't worry about:**
- Perfect content (placeholder is fine)
- Final polish (these are concept samples)
- Every page (just homepage)
- Complex interactions (keep it simple)
