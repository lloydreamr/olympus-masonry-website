## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Website Launch):
1. **Optimize for Web**: Run images through optimization script
   - Convert to WebP format
   - Resize to appropriate dimensions (1920x1080 for hero, 800x600 for gallery)
   - Compress for web performance

2. **Replace Placeholder Images**: Update homepage code to use curated images instead of Unsplash placeholders

3. **Crop IMG_0115.JPG**: Remove construction materials from bottom for Section 8 CTA background

### Image Gaps (Request from Peter):
1. **Team Photo**: Peter onsite with crew (for About page)
2. **Process Shots**: Clean work-in-progress shots showing craftsmanship (optional for "How We Work" section)
3. **Additional Winter Projects**: More images showing winter masonry work
4. **Interior Work**: More fireplace and interior stonework examples

### Medium-Term:
1. **Portfolio Page**: Use 13 curated gallery images on `/portfolio` page
2. **Services Pages**: Assign specific images to each service type
3. **Before/After Pairs**: If Peter has "before" shots, create comparison galleries
